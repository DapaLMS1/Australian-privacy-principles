Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) Quick Reference Guide 

ü¶∑ Project Overview

This is a single-page web application designed as a quick, accessible reference guide for Dental Assistants and healthcare students in Australia. It focuses specifically on the most relevant Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) derived from the Privacy Act 1988.

The primary goal is to translate complex privacy law requirements into simple, actionable steps that a dental assistant can implement in a clinical setting.

‚ú® Key Features

Quick Reference: An interactive sidebar allows users to select an APP and instantly view its details.

Actionable Requirements: Each principle is broken down into a clear "Key Requirement for Dental Assistants."

Practical Examples: The core feature is the direct, scenario-based examples showing the user what to do in practice (e.g., "As a dental assistant you will...").

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Visual Structure: Uses a distinct color palette (Deep Purple/Lavender) to enhance readability and visual appeal.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This application is built as a single, self-contained HTML file to maximize portability and ease of deployment.

HTML5: Structure of the application.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework for all styling and responsive layout management.

Vanilla JavaScript: Logic for handling navigation, state management (which APP is selected), and dynamically rendering content.

üéØ Target Audience

This tool is optimized for individuals working in or studying for roles within the Australian healthcare sector, specifically:

Dental Assistants

Trainee Healthcare Staff

Practice Managers (for training purposes)

Dental Receptionists
